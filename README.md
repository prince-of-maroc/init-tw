# init-tw

Add Tailwind to your Create React App project with one line.

```bash
  npx run init-tw
```

That's it. Everything Tailwind has to offer is now available to you, no repetitive manual set-up required.

## Features

**init-tw** only definitively works with Create React App projects. In the future, I plan to expand init-tw to be useable in any project.
